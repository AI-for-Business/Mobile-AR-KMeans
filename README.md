# What is this repository?
This repository contains a program called 'Mobile AR Application for KMeans Clustering', which allows an AR-based interactive visualization of the KMeans Clustering Algorithm. 
Start the program by running the Backend via python and deploy the frontend via Unity on a camera-equipped mobile device of your choice.

# What can I use it for?
You can use this software to start a python backend, as well as a Unity frontend for an interactive AR application that encompasses the basics of KMeans clustering.

# What do I need in order to use it?
This program contains a Frontend and a Backend.
The Frontend is built using Unity version 2022.1.20f1.
The Backend is built using Python version 3.10. It uses sklearn, as well as flask and gevent to start a simple server that handles the requests that are sent by the frontend.
You may need to adjust the IP-addresses, as well as keyfiles and certfiles.
